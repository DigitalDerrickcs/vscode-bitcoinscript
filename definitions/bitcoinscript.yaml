    keys remain to produce a successful result. All signatures need to match a public
    key. Because public keys are not checked again if they fail any signature comparison,
    signatures must be placed in the scriptSig using the same order as their corresponding
    public keys were placed in the scriptPubKey or redeemScript. If all signatures
    are valid, 1 is returned, 0 otherwise. Due to a bug, one extra unused value is
